# Original project

I've based my interpretation of the OpenWeather solution on [Weather Data in OMS Log Analytics](https://adatum.no/powershell/weather-data-in-oms-log-analytics)

## The PowerShell script

I took the PowerShell code from [this](https://github.com/ehrnst/OMSWeatherSolution/blob/master/AzureAutomationRunbook) PowerShell script.
